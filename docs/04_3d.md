# 3D

The 3D functions are currently under development. You can upload OBJ files and associated BMP or JPEG textures and view them in the 3D Window (<span class="cmd">3</span>). You can also morph between two objects that have the same geometry.

You can capture frames from moving 3D objects and create animated gifs.
