# Overview {-}

[WebMorph](https://webmorph.org) is a web-based version of [Psychomorph](http://users.aber.ac.uk/bpt/jpsychomorph/), with several additional functions. While WebMorph is optimized for averaging and transforming faces, you can delineate and average any type of image. WebMorph also has several batch functions for processing large numbers of images automatically and can even create moving gifs of your transforms.

WebMorph is made possible by the kind help of [Bernie Tiddeman](http://users.aber.ac.uk/bpt/), who developed and maintains the desktop version of [Psychomorph](http://users.aber.ac.uk/bpt/jpsychomorph/). WebMorph uses the open-source Java library [FaceMorphLib](http://users.aber.ac.uk/bpt/jpsychomorph/version6/javadoc/) and is developed and maintained by Lisa DeBruine.

WebMorph is currently in beta testing and is likely to remain so for some time. This means that there will be bugs and you cannot rely on the website being functional 100% of the time. Lisa will try to fix any problems as fast as possible, but she is the only person working on this project, so please be patient. If you're curious about the code or want to help with development, this project is open source at [GitHub](https://github.com/debruine/webmorph).
